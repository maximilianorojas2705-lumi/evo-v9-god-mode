   - Fine-grained control over execution paths for real-world scenarios
   - Secure, consistent state management between tasks
   - Clean integration of AI agents with production Python code
   - Conditional branching for complex business logic

The true power of CrewAI emerges when combining Crews and Flows. This synergy allows you to:

- Build complex, production-grade applications
- Balance autonomy with precise control
- Handle sophisticated real-world scenarios
- Maintain clean, maintainable code structure

### Getting Started with Installation

To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps. The full walkthrough lives in the [installation guide](https://docs.crewai.com/en/installation).

### 1. Installation

CrewAI requires `Python >=3.10 and <3.14`. Check your version with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling. If you haven't installed `uv` yet, install it first.

**macOS/Linux:**

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

```shell
wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

If you run into any issues, refer to [UV's installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then install the CrewAI CLI:

```shell
uv tool install crewai
```

If you encounter a `PATH` warning, run:

```shell
uv tool update-shell
```

If you encounter the `chroma-hnswlib==0.7.6` build error (`fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'float.h'`) on Windows, install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with *Desktop development with C++*.

Verify the install:

```shell
uv tool list
```

You should see something like:

```shell
crewai v0.102.0
- crewai
```

To upgrade the global CLI later:

```shell
uv tool install crewai --upgrade
```

This upgrades the **global `crewai` CLI tool** only. To upgrade the `crewai` version inside a project's virtual environment, see [Upgrading CrewAI in a project](https://docs.crewai.com/en/guides/migration/upgrading-crewai).

### 2. Setting Up Your Crew

`crewai create crew` creates a JSON-first crew project. Agents live in `agents/*.jsonc`, tasks and crew-level settings live in `crew.jsonc`, and `crewai run` loads that JSON definition directly.

```shell
crewai create crew <project_name>
```

This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:

```
my_project/
├── .gitignore
├── .env
├── agents/
│   └── researcher.jsonc
├── crew.jsonc
├── knowledge/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── skills/
└── tools/
```

If you need the older Python/YAML scaffold with `crew.py`, `config/agents.yaml`, and `config/tasks.yaml`, run:

```shell
crewai create crew <project_name> --classic
```

See [Using Annotations](https://docs.crewai.com/en/learn/using-annotations) for the classic pattern.

#### To customize your project, you can:

- Modify `agents/*.jsonc` to define each agent's role, goal, backstory, LLM, tools, and behavior.
- Modify `crew.jsonc` to define tasks, process, and input defaults.
- Add custom tools in `tools/` and reference them as `"custom:<name>"`.
- Add optional knowledge files in `knowledge/` and skill files in `skills/`.
- Add your environment variables into the `.env` file.

Use `{placeholder}` values in agent and task text, then set defaults in `crew.jsonc` under `inputs`. When you run `crewai run`, the CLI prompts for any missing values.

#### Example of a simple crew with a sequential process:

```shell
crewai create crew latest-ai-development
cd latest_ai_development
```

Then edit the generated files:

**agents/researcher.jsonc**

```jsonc
{
  "role": "{topic} Senior Data Researcher",
  "goal": "Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}",
  "backstory": "You're a seasoned researcher who finds relevant information and presents it clearly.",
  "llm": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "tools": ["SerperDevTool"],
  "settings": {
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

**agents/reporting_analyst.jsonc**

```jsonc
{
  "role": "{topic} Reporting Analyst",
  "goal": "Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings",
  "backstory": "You're a meticulous analyst who turns complex data into clear, concise reports.",
  "llm": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "settings": {
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

**crew.jsonc**

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Latest AI Development",
  "agents": ["researcher", "reporting_analyst"],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "research_task",
      "description": "Conduct thorough research about {topic}. Find recent, relevant information.",
      "expected_output": "A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}.",
      "agent": "researcher"
    },
    {
      "name": "reporting_task",
      "description": "Review the research and expand each topic into a full section for a report.",
      "expected_output": "A markdown report with the main topics, each with a full section of information. No fenced code blocks around the whole document.",
      "agent": "reporting_analyst",
      "context": ["research_task"],
      "output_file": "output/report.md",
      "markdown": true
    }
  ],
  "process": "sequential",
  "verbose": true,
  "inputs": {
    "topic": "AI Agents"
  }
}
```

### 3. Running Your Crew

Before running your crew, set the required keys in your `.env` file:

- Your model provider API key — see [LLM setup](https://docs.crewai.com/en/concepts/llms#setting-up-your-llm)
- A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key if you use web search: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`

Then install dependencies and run from the project directory:

```shell
crewai install
crewai run
```

If you need additional packages, use `uv add <package-name>`.

You should see the output in the console, and `output/report.md` should be created in the project root.

In addition to the sequential process, you can use the hierarchical process, which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results. [See more about the processes here](https://docs.crewai.com/en/concepts/processes).

For a Flow-first walkthrough, see the [Quickstart](https://docs.crewai.com/en/quickstart).

### Using Crews and Flows Together

CrewAI's power truly shines when combining Crews with Flows to create sophisticated automation pipelines.
CrewAI flows support logical operators like `or_` and `and_` to combine multiple conditions. This can be used with `@start`, `@listen`, or `@router` decorators to create complex triggering conditions.

- `or_`: Triggers when any of the specified conditions are met.
- `and_`: Triggers when all of the specified conditions are met.

Here's how you can orchestrate multiple Crews within a Flow:

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router, or_
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define structured state for precise control
class MarketState(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str = "neutral"
    confidence: float = 0.0
    recommendations: list = []

class AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):
    @start()
    def fetch_market_data(self):
        # Demonstrate low-level control with structured state
        self.state.sentiment = "analyzing"
        return {"sector": "tech", "timeframe": "1W"}  # These parameters match the task description template

    @listen(fetch_market_data)
    def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):
        # Show crew agency through specialized roles
        analyst = Agent(
            role="Senior Market Analyst",
            goal="Conduct deep market analysis with expert insight",
            backstory="You're a veteran analyst known for identifying subtle market patterns"
        )
        researcher = Agent(
            role="Data Researcher",
            goal="Gather and validate supporting market data",
            backstory="You excel at finding and correlating multiple data sources"
        )

        analysis_task = Task(
            description="Analyze {sector} sector data for the past {timeframe}",
            expected_output="Detailed market analysis with confidence score",
