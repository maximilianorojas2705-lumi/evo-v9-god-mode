# Changelog

All notable changes to AdClaw are documented in this file.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

---

## [1.0.9] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **MCP startup-abort cleanup**: initial MCP background initialization now starts only after the lifespan cleanup block is active, so failed startup does not leave orphaned MCP connection tasks.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **Hosted MCP startup readiness**: initial MCP client connections now run outside the FastAPI startup critical path so slow or unavailable external MCP services do not block hosted workspace readiness.
- **MCP lifecycle races**: stale startup/reload clients can no longer overwrite newer MCP config, and partially connected clients are closed when startup initialization is cancelled.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- **Hosted Host AI quota UX**: AdClaw now shows a clear included-message limit notice instead of a generic fallback failure when hosted Host AI quota is exhausted.
- **Fallback de-duplication**: provider fallback skips the active Host AI provider/model slot so a quota-limited hosted default is not retried as its own fallback.
- **Runner diagnostics hardening**: query logs no longer include user message previews, debug dumps explicitly keep `0600` file permissions, and persona-scoped session IDs are sanitized before filesystem persistence.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- **Session history resilience**: persisted chat history now ignores stale local media references after container or runtime path changes, keeping long-running deployments responsive across redeploys.
- **Provider fallback reliability**: fallback model initialization now reuses the shared model factory path so provider recovery stays consistent with normal runtime selection.
- **xAI model catalog refresh**: updated built-in Grok text-chat options to the current chat-compatible `grok-4.3` and `grok-4.20` lineup.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-05-17

### Changed
- **Runtime startup optimizations**: memory services now use safer defaults, explicit ReMe enablement, background initialization, load guards, and diagnostics so small servers stay responsive during startup.
- **Docker memory readiness**: release images preload the default embedding assets at build time and ship bounded memory-compaction defaults for more predictable first-run behavior.
- **Shared memory continuity**: chat turns can be captured into Always-On Memory without embedding latency and surfaced across persona-scoped sessions when AOM capture is enabled.
- **Channel idle efficiency**: QQ reconnect handling now uses bounded retry backoff to reduce idle churn during transient gateway or token refresh periods.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Xiaomi MiMo provider**: added first-class support for MiMo-V2.5-Pro, MiMo-V2.5, and MiMo-V2-Omni in the model registry, onboarding, and persona/model selection flows.
- **Hosted deploy docs refresh**: added and refined Railway and cross-platform deployment guidance so hosted users have an up-to-date path for Docker image variants, health checks, and persistent volumes.

### Changed
- **Versioned Docker examples** now point to `1.0.4` variant tags alongside `latest`, keeping deployment docs aligned with the current release line.
- **Official Docker release outputs** now publish consistent multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) manifests for `full`, `browser`, and `core`.

### Fixed
- **Console polish across core surfaces**: improved responsive behavior, sidebar collapse/popup behavior, chat composer styling, workspace mobile layout, and multiple Control surfaces including Sessions, Diagnostics, Cron Jobs, and Channels.
- **Shutdown reliability for local app and containers**: preserved caller cancellation during MCP teardown, treated benign grouped close cancellations as shutdown noise, and kept local shutdown quieter.
- **Console dependency hardening**: removed an unsafe `refractor` override and scoped npm overrides by parent dependency so installs remain stable while reducing audit debt.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Graceful MCP client degradation**: a single broken/unauthorized MCP client (e.g. expired API key) no longer crashes app startup or query handling. Failed clients are logged and skipped; agent continues with the remaining tools.
  - `agents/react_agent.py` `register_mcp_clients`: replaced re-raise with `continue`; added explicit `BaseExceptionGroup` branch (Python 3.11+ anyio TaskGroup teardown).
  - `app/mcp/manager.py` `init_from_config` and `replace_client`: catch `BaseExceptionGroup` alongside `Exception` so anyio TaskGroup errors don't propagate to FastAPI lifespan.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **14 LLM providers**: OpenAI (GPT-5.4, Codex Mini), Z.AI (GLM-4.7/4.6/4.5), Moonshot AI (Kimi K2.5, K2 Thinking), plus custom provider API
- **Dashboard page**: persona status cards with model, skills, cron preview
- **Per-persona chat tabs**: isolated sessions with shared AOM memory
- **@mention selector**: persona chip bar above chat input
- **Landing page** at website-landing/ (here.now-inspired design)
- Partner referral links for Aliyun and Z.AI in Welcome wizard
- 31 Mission Control tests + live E2E script

### Fixed
- PermissionError on `/app/logs` during MemoryManager start
- Dashboard white page (wrong API endpoints + missing array guards)
- Auto-retry narrowed to specific BadRequestError + user notification
- Sidebar popup menus: solid white background
- Diagnostics: human-readable formatting, newest errors first

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **AgentHub integration**: built-in agenthub-worker skill, Tasks button in Telegram
- **here.now file publishing**: instant shareable links for any file
- **Telegram Markdown**: bold/italic formatting with plain text fallback
- Console cleanup: removed all Chinese text, deleted language switcher
- Standardized CSS (spacing variables, drawer widths, typography)
- Security cleanup: removed hardcoded IPs, translated all Chinese runtime strings
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, dependabot.yml, docs/comparison.md

### Fixed
- Auto-retry with clean context when LLM rejects stale session
- Pinchtab crash loop (4 iterations of debugging)
