## 🧩 Definition & Scope
This repository focuses on:
- **Foundation-Model-Based Agents**: Autonomous systems that use foundation models as cognitive cores and operate through persistent scaffolds such as prompts, memory, tools, and control logic.
- **Self-Improvement Loops**: Agent-level update loops in which signals or artifacts produced through generation, intrinsic evaluation, or environment interaction are consolidated into persistent components of the agent.
- **Foundation Model Improvement**: Parameter-level updates driven by intrinsic generative demonstrations, intrinsic evaluative feedback, or extrinsic exploratory experience.
- **Scaffolding Improvement**: Persistent updates to prompts, memory, tools, workflows, or full agent scaffolds.

## 🧭 Taxonomy

If you are not yet familiar with agents, this simple illustration shows how an **FM-based agent** differs from a standalone **foundation model** (e.g., an LLM).

      An illustration of the distinction between a standalone foundation model and an FM-Based agent.
    </em>
  </p>
</details>

To ground our taxonomy, we first introduce a formal abstraction of a foundation model–based agent,
which serves as the basic unit for all self-improving agentic systems considered in this survey.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/agent_def.png" alt="Formal abstraction of an FM-based agent" width="55%">
  <br>
  <em>Formal abstraction of a foundation model–based agent, consisting of a foundation model and its scaffolding.</em>
</p>

Based on this abstraction, we categorize **self-improving agents** along two orthogonal axes,
depending on **which component is improved** during learning and adaptation.
